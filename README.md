# presence-watch
Detects via Philips Hue Motion Detectors and UPnP if someone is at home

Use it with AVMs FritzBox, Teufel Streaming products (or other UPnP media renderers) and Philips Hue Motion Sensors. 
Just modify the json file to your needs and execue python smarthome-presence.py.

The tool will is built to use on a central raspberry pi and will - later on - add the data to a couch db, so you can request by
timestamp if someone is at home. This data can be used to control your heater or something else.

Enjoy!
